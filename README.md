# BuildWithAI-Emotion-Detection-Model-on-Twitter

To understand the public reaction about COVID-19, we need to apply NLP processing on tweets, to know and translate their what people think about virus in the world, if they believe it or not, the size of the pandemic. Analysis can help governments and countries to decide how to control instructions and if people follow it or not. 

The work done in this research was a proof of concept that people emotions tell a lot of things and through analysing these emotions we can understand peopleâ€™s opinion toward different things such as government rules and actions in response to covid-19.
